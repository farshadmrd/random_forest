# Car Evaluation Random Forest Classifier
This project aims to car evaluation using the Random Forest algorithm.
# Features
* Model training with Random Forest
* Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search and Randomized Search
* Evaluation metrics including feature importance, classification report, and confusion matrix



# Dataset
Derived from simple hierarchical decision model, this database may be useful for testing constructive induction and structure discovery methods.
Additional Information:
Car Evaluation Database was derived from a simple hierarchical decision model originally developed for the demonstration of DEX, M. Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision making
